pip install PyAudio
pip will fetch and install PyAudio wheels for official distributions of Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
But if you are using python 3.7 and  above pip won't directly install.
So download and install wheel from **https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/**
Wheels for 32 and 64-bit python 3.7, python 3.8, etc are available
Notice while selecting file cp38 means CPython 3.8
After downloading .whl file , go and save it in your root folder.
Then to  install directly from a wheel archive(.whl file)
pip install SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
